# **App Name**: GitCourseGen

## Core Features:

- Course Outline Generation: Generate a course outline based on a user-provided topic, using the Gemini API as a planning tool.
- Markdown Conversion: Convert course content generated by the Gemini API into properly formatted Markdown files.
- GitHub Integration: Connect to the user's GitHub account to push the generated Markdown files directly to a specified repository. It stores API keys into environment placeholders
- Environment Variable Handling: Guide users through adding their Github api token in order for Github integration to work
- Real-time Preview: Show a preview of the formatted course material.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark grey (#24292e), mimicking GitHub's dark mode.
- Background color: Very dark grey (#0d1117), providing high contrast for readability.
- Accent color: Teal (#2ea44f), used for highlighting interactive elements and success states.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, for headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different course elements (lessons, quizzes, etc.). Icons should be light grey or teal.
- Maintain a clean, user-friendly layout with clear sections for input, content generation, and GitHub integration.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback during the content generation and GitHub pushing processes. Animations should be smooth and fast.
